part of your assignment.

Suppose Alice and Bob are US citizens and Alice sends an SMS message to Bob through Verizon.

1. If the police obtain a warrant and make a request to Verizon, can Verizon provide them with
 a copy of the message - yes or no? - one word answer:
 Yes

2. Suppose instead Alice sends a message to Bob using an end-to-end encrypted messaging, and
 the bytes of the message flow through Verizon. Does Verizon have a copy of the plaintext of
 the message to provide to the police? Explain briefly.

Your answer: End-to-end encryption adds a layer to the warrant. The key stays the local device of the users.
Everything in transit is a cypher-text. So if authorities request, they will not be able to provide it because
they don't have the key even if they have the text.So only users can decrupt and they have greater control
 on the information.
